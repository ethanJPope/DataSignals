Welcome to Signal Runner - A world where you are a packet trying to make it to the datacenter with the lowest latency

## How to play
You play as a packet moving through a wire. You can control your virtical movement and your horizontal motion is dependant on how close you are to the glowing pink path. Your player is also attracted toward the yellow and red packets found in your way.
If you touch one then you get a major speed deficit.
